# README

Welcome to my emacs config. Please see `matt-e-macs.org` for instructions on how to populate.

## DISCLAIMER

This emacs takes heavy heavy inspiration from [Protesilaos Stavrou's emacs](https://protesilaos.com/emacs/dotemacs#h:7b7b5898-09f7-4128-8af0-4041f67cb729). Until I get 
more proficient at `emacs`, I will be styling my config after his configuration.

## HOW-TO

Steps:
1. `git clone` repo
2. Open `matt-e-macs.org` and "tangle" the code blocks (`C-c v t`)
   * This will populate `matt-e-macs-modules/`
3. Close and open emacs

## TODO's

* I need to further write out my own documentation for the code blocks in `matt-e-macs.org`.
* Play around with customizing the code blocks to my liking. Involves learning "emacs-lisp".
