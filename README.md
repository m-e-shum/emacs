# README

## Description
My `.emacs.d/init.el` is based/inspired off of [Gavin Freeborn](https://github.com/Gavinok/emacs.d/blob/main/init.el). I have yet to master all the functionality he includes but I like how he has chosen modern emacs packages that is fast. My previous `init.el` had very slow code completion and weird auto-indenting at times.
